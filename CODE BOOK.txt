CODE BOOK
1.R script called run_analysis.R is created .
2.Datset is donloaded from link provided.
3.Data from respective files in the folder is assigned to variables , 
1)features –features.txt
2)activities-acitivity_labels.txt
3)subject-test-subject_test.txt
4)x-test-x_test.txt
5)y-test-y_test.txt
6)subject_train-subject-train.txt
7)x_train-x_train.txt
8)y_train-y_train.txt

4.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
        1.x-rbind of x_train and x_test
       2.y-rbind of y_train and y_test
       3.subject-rbind of subject_train and subject_test
       4.merge-cbind of subject ,x,y
       

5.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  Only those columns are selected from merge where standdard deviation and mean are present     using select
1. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
2. Acc in column’s name replaced by Accelerometer
3.  Gyro in column’s name replaced by Gyroscope
4.  BodyBody in column’s name replaced by Body
5.  Mag in column’s name replaced by Magnitude
6. words starting with character f in column’s name replaced by Frequency
7. words starting with character t in column’s name replaced by Time
8. lines with mean is replaced by word mean
9. lines with std is replaced by word standard_deviation
 6.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
New data set  with average of each variable and activity is created-summarisedata, and written in a new file "Avg_var_by_activity.txt"
